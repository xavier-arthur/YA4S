# YA4S

A rust-written imageboard scrapper

## Usage

```bash
yass 'https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/86554039' -o ~/Pictures
```

The above args would download every image posted into the supplied URL to
`~/Pictures/86554039`. Note that this software was written with 4channel in mind
but i **should** work with the majority of the imageboards
